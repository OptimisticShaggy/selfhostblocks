# Self Host Blocks

*Building blocks for self-hosting with battery included.*

SHB's (Self Host Blocks) goal is to provide a lower entry-bar for self-hosting. I intend to achieve
this by providing opinionated building blocks fitting together to self-host a wide range of
services. Also, the design will be extendable to allow users to add services not provided by SHB.
